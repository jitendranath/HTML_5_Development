HTML Forms
-----------
-> The HTML Form is an area which contains various form fields to fills in the form data and send to the server side program for further processing.
-> The HTML Forms are divided into three categories,

 1) HTML Form Elements
 2) HTML Form Input Types
 3) HTML Form Attributes
 
-> In the HTML, when a user fills in the form data and click on the submit button then, the browser collects the form data and sends a HTTP Request to the server side program.
-> HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is used to transfer the form data between the browser and the server.
-> The HTTP Request is having various methods like  GET and POST.
-> The GET method is used to get the data from the server.
-> the POST method is used to post some data to the server.
-> For HTML Form submission we have  to use 'POST' Method.
-> The Complete HTML Form is represented with the tag <form>

1) HTML Form Elements/Tags
--------------------------
-> The HTML Form elements are used to display various form fields on the webpage.

1)<form> Tag
------------
-> The HTML <form> indicates the complete HTML Form.
-> This acts as container to hold all kinds of HTML Form Elements/tags.
-> We have to define all the HTML form elements insid the <form> tag only.

Ex: <form method='POST' action='abc.php'>
		-----
    </form>
	
	Here 'method' attribute indicates the HTTP method to send the form data.
	'action' attribute indicates the serverside program, which is responsible for handling the form data.

2) <label> , <input> tags
---------------------------
-> <input> tag is used to display various input fields on the webpage like textbox , password box , submit button , reset button , check box etc.
-> the <label> tag indicates the actual display label text for the specific input field.

Ex: <form>
		<label for='user'>User Name</label>
		<input type='text' id='user'>
    </form>

Note:
------
	-> Here the 'for' attribute of a <label> tag should always equals to the 'id' attribute of any input field.
	-> This is the connection between the <label> tag and <input> tag.
	
3) <select> Tag
----------------
-> <select> tag is used to display a select box on the webpage. 
-> Each option inside the <select> tag is represented with the <option> tag.

Ex:  <form>
        <label for="lang">Select a Language</label>
        <select id="lang">
            <option>HTML</option>
            <option>CSS</option>
            <option>JavaScript</option>
        </select>
    </form>

4) <textarea> Tag
-----------------
-> The <textarea> tag is used to display a comments box or a message-box on the webpage.
-> This tag is having two special attributes likes 'rows' and 'cols'.
-> here 'rows' indicates the height of the textarea.
        'cols' indicates the width of the textarea.
		
Ex: <form>
		<label for='msg'>Your Message</label>
		<textarea rows='5' cols='20' id='msg'></textarea>
    </form>

5) <datalist> Tag
-----------------
-> This tag is introduced in the HTML5 version.
-> This is the refinment of <select> tag.
-> Here in the datalist, all options will be displayed based on the search query we provide in the <datalist> box.
-> This is just like a google search box.

Ex:<form>
		<label for='lang'>select a Language</label>
		<input list='lang'>
		<datalist id='lang'>
			<option>HTML</option>
			<option>CSS</option>
			<option>JavaScript</option>
		</datalist>
   </form>
