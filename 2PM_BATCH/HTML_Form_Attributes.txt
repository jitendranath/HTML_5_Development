HTML Form Input Attributes
---------------------------
-> The HTML Form input attributes are used to apply some special effects for the input form fields on the webpage.
-> The HTML form input attributes are as follows,

1) value=""
-----------
-> The value attribute indicates the actual value of the input fields.
-> This value attribute is having the connection with the server side program with this perticular input field.

-> This attribute is used to make any input field as readonly field or a unmodifiable field.


3) disabled
------------
-> This attribute is used to disable any input field to enter some data in that field.
-> This is better than the 'readonly' attribute.

HTML5 Form input attributes
---------------------------
-> The following are HTML 5 version of form input attributes

1) required
------------
-> By default all the form fields are optional fields means without filling those fields also we can submit the form.
-> the 'required' is used to convert any form field as a mandatory field or required field.

2) novalidate
-------------
-> Each HTML5 form elements are having its own default validation messages.
-> If we wants to apply our own validation messages, first we have to disable the default validation messages and apply our own validation messages using JavaScript / JQuery / Angular JS.
-> to disable the default validation messages we have to 'novalidate' attribute. We have to use this for the <form> tag itself.

3) autofocus
------------
-> By default NONE of input field is autofocused.
-> If we wants to apply any specific form field as automatically focused we have to use 'autofocus' attribute.

-> Most of the HTML form fields are having its own pattern.
-> We can override the existing pattern and apply our own pattern for the specific form fields is by using 'pattern' attribute.

5) placeholder
